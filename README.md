## üìñ Overview  

The **To-Do List Application** is a simple, yet powerful web-based task management system designed to help users efficiently organize their daily activities. This project was developed as part of my internship at **CODTECH IT SOLUTIONS**.  

The application provides an interactive user experience, enabling users to create, edit, delete, and view tasks seamlessly. A visually appealing UI with a circular frame and light blue accents makes task management enjoyable. The use of **local storage** ensures that tasks persist even after the browser is closed, emphasizing data persistence without needing a backend server.

This project not only demonstrates my proficiency in **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** but also showcases a practical implementation of real-world frontend development principles.
